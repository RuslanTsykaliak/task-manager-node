# RESTful Task Manager API

## Overview

This project is a robust and scalable backend RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for managing tasks. It provides core functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, with data persistence using MongoDB.

## Motivation

The goal of this project was to build a practical backend API that demonstrates key concepts of server-side development, including routing, data handling, database interaction, and RESTful principles.

## Key Features

* **CRUD Operations:** Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks.
* **RESTful Endpoints:** Follows RESTful API conventions for clear and intuitive interaction.
* **Data Persistence:** Utilizes MongoDB to store and retrieve task data.
* **JSON Response:** Returns data in JSON format for easy integration with frontend applications.
* **Middleware:** Includes middleware for handling "not found" routes and general error handling.
* **Environment Variables:** Uses `.env` file for managing sensitive information like the MongoDB connection URI.
